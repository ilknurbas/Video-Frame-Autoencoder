Frame difference techniques are essential for video compression, as they help reduce redundancy by encoding only the changes between consecutive frames rather than storing each frame independently. This approach is widely used in modern compression algorithms, such as H.264 and H.265, where motion estimation and compensation allow efficient encoding. Autoencoders, like the one used in this script, can learn these frame differences and predict upcoming frames, enabling even more optimized compression. By leveraging deep learning for difference-based encoding, video storage and transmission become more efficient while maintaining visual quality. This method is particularly valuable for applications like video streaming, surveillance, and real-time processing, where bandwidth and storage optimization are critical.
